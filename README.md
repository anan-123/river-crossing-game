# RIVER CROSSING GAME

Welcome to the game! 

The game has two players.Each one has to move from start to end.

One player plays at a time.

Both players are a cat.

The control keys are up,down,left,right in keyboard for both the players.

Scoring mechanism:


If you cross fixed obstacle (dark blue slab) : 5 points

If you cross moving obstacle (light blue slab) : 10 points

If you move in opp.direction of end : for coming back in :
        
                                     :1.dark blue slab: -8 points
                                     :2.light blue slab : -13 points


(i.e lose points for crossing the previous obstacle and -3 points for coming back)

At the end of each level a winner will be declared based on scores.If score is same then the player who took lesser time wins.

For the next level the previous score of the player will be added.

The timer will continue with previous value for each player

If any of the players touches an obstacle the player dies and the next player plays.
Only if both players finish the level without dying the level increases (the speed of moving obstacles increases) else they will relay the same level.

Game continues until the player wishes to close the window
